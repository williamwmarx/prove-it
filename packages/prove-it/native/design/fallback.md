# No TypeScript engine fallback

What `check` does where the native engine declines a model or can't be loaded, now that the
TypeScript engine is deleted. The plan was written for the owner on 2026-11-09 (branch
`fallback-plan`); the owner chose option C below the same day, and this records it as built.

## The chain

`check` (src/check.ts) tries, in order:

1. `getEngineIneligibility`. Some models never reach the engine: `PROVE_IT_ENGINE=0`, `-dump`,
   `-continue`, a periodic config and TLC 1.7.4. A spec without an initial predicate or a
   next-state relation doesn't either. The interpreter checks these, as TLC's semantics need and
   as the user asked.
2. The native engine (`checkNatively` in src/engine/native.ts). It returns:
   - `complete`: the search, which the interpreter replays only to check temporal properties and
     print a counterexample;
   - `stopped` or `invariant`: a violation, a deadlock or a run-time stop, with the search so far
     as a checkpoint the interpreter goes on from to print TLC's trace;
   - `declined`: the engine produced no state, and the interpreter checks the whole model;
   - `unavailable`: no engine loads, and `check` throws `EngineUnavailableError`.
3. The interpreter, which is the reference: it checks what the engine declines, goes on from a
   stop, and prints every trace.

The TypeScript engine was step 3 before, between the native engine and the interpreter. It is
gone, with `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_BACKEND`, `PROVE_IT_CODEGEN`, `PROVE_IT_STORE_TRACE` and
`PROVE_IT_MEMO`'s report. A decline now goes straight to the interpreter, which is correct but much
slower; the gaps workstream ([gaps.md](gaps.md)) takes the declines to zero.

## Where no engine loads (option C)

`getNativeAddon` loads, in order:

- the module `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_WASM` names, if set;
- where there is `process.dlopen` (Node, Bun): the addon `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_ADDON` names, the one an
  executable embeds, or the one in the platform package installed for this system; failing those,
  the WebAssembly engine from the `@atemp/prove-it-wasm32` package, which has no `os` or `cpu`
  fields, so an unlisted platform (riscv64, FreeBSD, win32 arm64 and so on) still searches
  natively. An addon named by `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_ADDON` or embedded is the only one tried;
- where there is none (a browser): the WebAssembly engine `loadWasmEngine` fetched and compiled
  before the check, from the wasm32 package or beside the module (DESIGN.md 7.4).

Where none loads, `check` throws `EngineUnavailableError` (src/errors.ts, exported). Its message
gives the loader's reason and says to install the package with its optional dependencies on a
supported platform, or to set `PROVE_IT_ENGINE=0` to check with the interpreter. The CLI prints it
and exits with 255, TLC's exit code for an internal error. Nothing falls back to a slower search
unasked.

Who reaches the error: `npm install --omit=optional` and its equivalents, a lockfile written on
another platform under npm's optional-dependency bug (npm/cli#4828), a copy of `dist/` without
`node_modules`, and a platform package from another release (an ABI mismatch).

## Where the interpreter remains a fallback

- **A decline.** The engine declined before producing any state.
- **A stop.** A violation or a deadlock hands over the search so far, and the interpreter prints
  TLC's trace from it. A run-time stop the engine doesn't model does the same.
- **A WebAssembly trap.** The engine's frames are on the host's call stack there, which is
  shallower than the addon's search thread, so a deep recursion can trap. The loader replaces the
  instance and returns a stop that hands nothing over, and the interpreter searches from the start
  (src/engine/wasm.ts). This is the one fallback that is not a semantic hand-over; it stays until
  the engine's recursion no longer runs on the host's stack.

Each of these reports itself under `PROVE_IT_ENGINE=debug` (`native: declined: …`,
`handed over after …`).

## What was deleted

The TypeScript engine's search and compiler, about 7,400 lines: `src/engine/compile.ts`,
`action.ts`, `codegen.ts`, `memo.ts`, `context.ts`, `search.ts`, `live.ts`, `symmetry.ts` and
`state-log.ts`. The types the native path still uses (`EngineCheckpoint`, `EngineResult`,
`EngineGraph`, `LiveOracle`) moved to `native.ts`, and `IrSpec` to `ir.ts`.

With it went its tests (the memo tables, the store trace, `ts-only-tests.json`), the scripts that
read its internals (`native-expressions.ts`, `native-replay.ts`, `store-replay.ts`), the `ts`
backend of the conformance scripts and the Parity pairs that named it (`ts/rust`, `tlc/ts`,
`ts/interpreter`, `ts/stopped`), and `coverage-allowlist.json`, which gated the native engine's
coverage against it. The native search tests that compared state logs with it now compare the
native state log with the states the interpreter writes to TLC's `-dump`, in TLC's order.

What stays: `ir.ts` (the TypeScript front end's lowering, until `tla-front` replaces it);
`store.ts`, `convert.ts` and `fingerprint.ts`, the bridge that decodes the native states for the
interpreter and the store tests' oracle; `native.ts`, `wasm.ts` and `settings.ts`; and the
interpreter, with `PROVE_IT_ENGINE=0`.

## Tests need the engine

Every check needs an engine, so `bun run test` builds the addon for this system
(`platform-packages.ts build`) before it runs, and `tests/setup.ts`, which `bunfig.toml` preloads,
points `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_ADDON` at it unless it or `PROVE_IT_ENGINE_WASM` is set. Running the tests
needs the pinned Rust toolchain; Verification's Test task and Release's test step bootstrap it.
